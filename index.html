                    First, we have to understand what Git and VS Code is, so let's start with a quick breakdown of what each is and why they are important.

                    <p>
                        Through Git's branching model, you can easily create, merge, and delete multiple branches independent of each other, local or remote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This allows for multiple workflows on a single project that can be implemented seamlessly. Additionally, its distributed nature means that the number of workflows can be unlimited.

                    <h3>What is Branching?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Branching is basically how you separate spaces to work on a single project. You can create a branch from an existing branch, create a new branch entirely, 
                        or create a detached branch. Each of these options have their own purpose, but the main idea is branching isolates changes you make. This keeps the 
                        integrity of your main branch together, and also manages what spaces people are working in. If you think about feature development, this allows a team to 
                        have individual branches for specific features, all of which can be created from the same main branch, and experiment before implementing them into the main branch.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is also the same for bug fixes, as developers can assess and experiment with solutions or breaking in another branch so the in-progress edits do not affect the main branch</p>

                        Once you have your branch created, you can commit changes (sync changes) to update the remote repository, or you can keep the branch local.

                           Using “sync changes” will both pull and push from the remote repository.  This is an easy way to keep your local repository current with the project. If you do not want to use this method, you can also use the ellipses in the side panel of the “source control” menu. This opens a list of options (push, pull, clone, fetch) to choose from.

                    <h3>My thoughts on Pull Requests</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I start this with 'my thoughts' because pull requests can be a bit confusing to understand their place in development. From my understanding, means that you are 
                        submitting some code that you have created in a separate branch from the main(default). This is meant to either garner feedback on your code or to try and have 
                        your code contributed to a project that you do not own. This is great for collaboration and revisement because it opens up an environment for discussion, one 
                        where people can give feedback and build on your work. It also is a safegaurd for version control and file integrity, 
                        as pull requests are a prerequisite to implementation.

                            Make sure you have made a respository for your project on Github.
