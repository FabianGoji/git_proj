                        Git is a version control system that developers use to manage and track changes in their code. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other, 
                        by creating and merging branches and handling conflicts. Git stores a history of all changes made to the project, enabling developers to revert to previous versions if necessary and to see who made which 
                        changes and when. This makes it an essential tool for collaborative coding and managing complex projects.

                        Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful and versatile code editor used by developers for writing, editing, and debugging code. It supports a wide range of programming languages 
                        and comes with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and integrated Git control, making coding more efficient and less error-prone. VS Code also offers a vast library 
                        of extensions, allowing developers to customize their environment with additional tools and features to suit their specific needs, enhancing productivity in software development.

                        A repository on GitHub is like a special folder for a project. It's where all the files, documents, and information related to that project are kept. 
                        Think of it as a digital library bookshelf, where each book &lpar;or repository&rpar; holds all the pages &lpar;files&rpar; for one topic &lpar;project&rpar;. On GitHub, people can 
                        work together on these projects, like adding new pages or editing existing ones, and everyone can see the changes. It's a way to organize, share, and 
                        collaborate on projects online, even if you're not a tech expert.

                    <h3>What is Branching?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Branching is basically how you separate spaces to work on a single project. You can create a branch from an existing branch, create a new branch entirely, 
                        or create a detached branch. Each of these options have their own purpose, but the main idea is branching isolates changes you make. This keeps the 
                        integrity of your main branch together, and also manages what spaces people are working in. If you think about feature development, this allows a team to 
                        have individual branches for specific features, all of which can be created from the same main branch, and experiment before implementing them into the main branch.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is also the same for bug fixes, as developers can assess and experiment with solutions or breaking in another branch so the in-progress edits do not affect the main branch</p>

                        Think of a commit on GitHub as a bookmark in a notebook. When you make changes to your project 
                        &lpar;like writing or editing pages in the notebook&rpar;, a commit marks exactly what changes you made at that moment. 
                        It's like saying, "Here's what I added or changed on this page today." This bookmark helps you and others see 
                        the history of changes made over time. It's a way of keeping track of all the small or big updates you make, 
                        like a diary entry for your project, making it easy to understand how the project has evolved.

                        "Pushing" these changes to a remote repository, like GitHub, is like sending photocopies of your updated scrapbook pages to a public 
                        library. This way, your updated pages are available in the library for others to see and use &lpar;the GitHub repository&rpar;. So, pushing is 
                        essentially the act of sharing your local updates with the wider world on the internet, making your latest work accessible to others 
                        and ensuring that the public library &lpar;GitHub&rpar; has the most current version of your project.

                        This might sound similar to commits, but they are still very different. If commits note what the changes are on your local repository, then pushing those changes
                        is basically sending the commit&lpar;s&rpar; to the remote repository. The message you leave in a commit is even more necessary here since other collaborators need to
                        know about the changes you made.

                           Using “sync changes” will both pull and push from the remote repository.  This is an easy way to keep your local repository current with the project. If you do not want to use this method, you can also use the ellipses in the side panel of the “source control” menu. This opens a list of options (push, pull, clone, fetch) to choose from.

                        A pull request on GitHub is like putting a suggestion box in a community center. Imagine you've made some great changes or improvements to a project 
                        you found at the center &lpar;like a shared recipe book&rpar;. Instead of just replacing the original, you put your suggestions &lpar;your updated pages&rpar; in the 
                        suggestion box. This is your pull request. It's a way of saying, "Hey, I made some changes I think are good, can we add them to the original project?" 
                        The community &lpar;or project owners&rpar; can then review your suggestions, discuss them, and decide whether to incorporate them into the main project. It's a 
                        collaborative and respectful way of contributing improvements to a shared project.

                        GitHub Pages is a service provided by GitHub that allows you to host a website directly from your GitHub repository, making it an excellent choice for deploying a website. 
                        It's especially beneficial because it's free, easy to set up, and integrates seamlessly with Git version control. This means you can update your website simply by pushing 
                        updates to your repository. GitHub Pages is ideal for personal, project, or documentation websites, as it supports static site generators like Jekyll for more complex projects. 
                        Its simplicity and integration with GitHub's ecosystem make it a popular choice for developers looking to quickly and efficiently publish their work online.
